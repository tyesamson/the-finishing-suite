***1.0 Services Rendered***

We agree to provide the services to you in accordance to what is outlined in the quote. Throughout the process you will have opportunities to review the work produced and provide feedback. If, at any stage, you’re not happy with the direction our work is taking and wish to cancel this contract, we will require full payment of the work produced up until the time of the request for the contract to be cancelled. All final sign off including proofing all wording is your responsibility. We cannot guarantee that our work will be errorfree, so we can’t be liable to you or any third-party for any incidental, consequential or special damages.

***2.0 Mutual Co-operation***

We agree to use our best efforts to exceed your expectation on the deliverables quoted for. You agree to provide us any information required pertaining to creating the deliverables and to cooperate with us in completing the work outlined.

***3.0 Charges for Additional Services Performed***

Additional services required that are beyond the scope or initial quote will be
quoted out as extra and sent to you for separate approval.

***4.0 Terms of Payment***

***4.1 Billing Schedule and Payment Terms***

We’re sure you understand how important it is that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly. We’re also sure you’ll want to maintain a positive working relationship and keep the project moving forward, so you agree to stick tight to the following payment schedule. We require you to pay a deposit of thirty per cent (30%) of the project quote at the point of accepting these Terms of Service. The project can get underway once the deposit has been received. The remaining seventy per cent (70%) will be invoiced on completion of the project and payment will be required within 7 days of the invoice date. Projects that are put on hold for longer than 45 days will require the costs to date to be settled in which a part payment invoice will be sent to you. You will supply us with all necessary purchase order numbers and other internal information required for invoice processing on acceptance of the quote.

***4.2 Overdue or Unpaid Invoices***

We will charge a late payment fee of 2% per week on any overdue and unpaid invoice balances if payment is not received within the 7 days. Late
payment fee will cover the manpower, interest, and other costs we are required to pay for carrying overdue invoices. In addition, we reserve the
right to put on hold with any additional projects that are being worked on for this client until payment is received.

***4.3 Collection Costs***

In the event that we incur legal fees, costs and disbursements in an effort to collect our invoices, in addition to interest on the unpaid invoice balance, you agree to reimburse us for these expenses.

***5.0 Cancellation of Services***

You have the right to modify, reject, cancel or stop any projects. However, you agree to reimburse us for all costs and expenses we incurred prior to your change in instructions, and which relate to non-cancellable commitments, and to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless for any liability relating to such action. We agree to use our best efforts to minimise such costs and expenses.

***6.0 Responsibilities***

***(a) Company’s Responsibilities***

We shall obtain licenses, permits or other authorisation to use imagery, typography, photographs, art work or any other property or rights belonging
to third parties obtained by us for use in performing services for you (If applicable).

***(b) Client’s Responsibilities***

You guarantee that all elements of text, images, or other artwork you provide are either owned by you or that you have permission to use them.
On completion of the project you will receive all finished artwork files. All original open artwork files will be stored by us. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them. We’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design.

You are responsible for the accuracy, completeness and propriety of information concerning your products and services which you provide to us verbally or in writing.
