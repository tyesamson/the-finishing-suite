title: Why Pre-Conformed Workflows Are A Shortcut That You Should Try To Avoid

There are two ways that 

Personally, I hate being delivered flat pre-conformed masters and much prefer to be given camera original neg. This way, I can ensure that every piece of the image processing pipeline is done optimally and I am not left second-guessing how an image or its metadata might've been unwittingly mishandled prior to being flattened and sent to me.

In saying that, I know plenty of really good colorists who feel that conforming and ensuring image purity is not their responsibility and they ONLY accept flat pre-conformed files. They see their job as being to take what's given to them and make that look as good as possible.

It has a lot to do with whether the colorist considers themselves to also be performing the role of an online editor/finishing artist or strictly color. I don't trust many other people with this stuff and so I want as much control over the entire finishing process as possible. Many others consider that stuff outside the scope of their role, and they're not wrong to think that. They're just two completely different mindsets.

So, as many have already said, every colorist is different. Ask them, not Reddit. Any colorist worth their salt will have a handover document ready to send you with detailed instructions.



The colour and online/finishing process relies heavily on both metadata and image purity.

In a pre-conformed workflow, I have no idea what may have been burned into the picture, including potential colour mistakes like incorrectly scaled video-data levels, resizes and scaling done with sub-optimal algorithms, poor motion interpretation etc all of which is very common in NLE’s designed for editing, not finishing.

For these reasons, this way of bypassing the conform process really is only ever a last resort for me.

My preferred workflow where possible is to conform to original camera media with an AAF (if coming from Avid) or an XML (if coming from Premiere) and even when I am provided a pre-conformed working master like this I am usually provided an EDL which at least gives me a tiny bit of metadata. As a last resort I can scene-detect without an EDL, but again, it is my opinion that this is not in the best interests of making your images look as good as they can.

I do accept that sometimes there are situations where a pre-conformed working master is unavoidable, so if there is no other way of handing over the edit then I will go ahead and scene-cut this MOV, however, I won’t be able to guarantee that the images are the best that they can possibly be, because of the media’s severed chain of custody.
