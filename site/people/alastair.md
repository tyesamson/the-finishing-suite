<p class="mt-5">For more than 18 years I have worked as an Online Editor, Colourist, and all-around motion picture finishing nerd.</p>
<p>Over those years I've used DaVinci Resolve, Autodesk Smoke, Avid Symphony, and DS Nitris (IYKYK!) to finesse films, television shows, music videos, and commercial TV spots to be more awesome. I am fast and meticulous, with an up-to-date knowledge of technology and a strong creative eye.</p>
<p class="mb-0">After more than 20 years of experience in the screen industries working with companies like Weta Digital, Warner Brothers NZ, Images&Sound, South Pacific Pictures, Jam TV, NHNZ, and heaps of others; in 2016 I founded The Finishing Suite -- a boutique picture finishing facility on Brown Street in Ponsonby.</p>
