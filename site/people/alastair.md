<p class="mt-5">For fifteen years I have worked as an Online Editor, Colourist, and all-round motion picture finishing nerd.</p>
<p>I offer inspiration and experience using DaVinci Resolve, Autodesk Smoke, and Avid Symphony to finesse films, television shows, music videos and TVCs to be more awesome. I am fast and meticulous with an up-to-date knowledge of technology and a strong creative eye.</p>
<p>Over my 20 years experience in the screen industries I have worked with many high profile companies such as Weta Digital, Images&Sound, Warner Brothers NZ, South Pacific Pictures, Jam TV and heaps of others.</p>
<p>I love stories and storytelling. In 2009 I co-founded Hybrid Motion Pictures, a filmmaking collective with whom I produced and self-distributed my first indie feature film, JAKE, which was released theatrically in 2014.</p>
